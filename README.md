# Naruto

This was an end-of-the-year project back in 10 class. In this HTML you can read about the Naruto series. I wrote a little summary and I hope it brings your mood to start it to watch. On the last page, you find a little quiz where you can find out which character you are.

In the quiz, there are five characters and some questions and you need to choose one of them and at the end, you get the answer to which character you are.
